        <p>Communication is something we all use to some degree to connect and share information with others. It is an
            essential skill which we use daily in various environments. Each scenario requires a different approach and
            technique to ensure a clear message is delivered.</p>

        <p>Poor communication can cause misunderstanding, which in turn can lead to less than favourable results.
            Workplace communication is no different. The effectiveness of communication within the workplace can
            directly impact productivity, morale, safety, and employee engagement.</p>

        <p>Over recent years the ease in which we can communicate has improved significantly. But, with these changes,
            it has also become <a
                href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/8615989/One-in-three-overwhelmed-by-technology.html"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Article about feeling overwhelmed by technology">easier to be
                overwhelmed</a> with a barrage of e-mails, messages, alerts, and phone calls. Due to the sheer volume of
            communication, it is understandable that the message isn’t always received as intended, and in some cases
            can go completely unnoticed.</p>

        <p>So, what can digital signage offer to improve workplace communication? </p>

        <h2>Reiterate key messaging with digital signage</h2>

        <p>Signage and posters are already used to a certain extent within organizations to communicate with their
            teams. However, the current static delivery method still used by most businesses today is quickly outdated
            and therefore, often not in line with current areas of focus within the business. </p>

        <p><a href="https://avido.com.au/digital-displays-hardware.html" title="Browse digital signage" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">Digital signage</a> allows organizations to deliver dynamic content which can easily be
            changed to reiterate messaging delivered over other channels. If employees haven’t had a chance to view the
            latest communications on the intranet, or via e-mail, they also have the opportunity to view the message as
            they step away from the computer.</p>

        <p>It allows internal communications to be delivered in a variety of formats to ensure the message is
            communicated as clearly as possible. This means signage can now easily be updated at the same time as other
            channels to ensure communication across the whole business is saying the same thing. Giving employees
            multiple ways to take messaging onboard.</p>

        <h3>Create an engaged workplace</h3>

        <p>Workplace communication is not a one-way street. For communication to be <a
                href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships-communication/effective-communication.htm"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="A look at effective communication">truly effective</a> all parties
            involved must feel heard and understood. As such, digital signage provides a flexible platform that can
            deliver varied content. The space previously taken by static signage now becomes a space that can deliver
            changing dynamic content.</p>

        <p>It can allow employees to easily share appropriate content to communicate their wins, challenges and
            solutions. Depending on the culture of the business it can be used by employees to share content they feel
            may help others, or maybe something to lighten the mood. </p>

        <img src="images/personalised-content.png" alt="personalised content showcasing employees">

        <h3>Personalised, relevant content</h3>

        <p>One of the key strengths of digital signage is how easily content can be changed and delivered across the
            network. This gives organizations the ability to deliver specific content to specific screens within the
            business. Workplace communication can become more targeted with certain messaging delivered only to the
            areas in which it’s applicable.</p>

        <p>Business wide communications can still be delivered across the whole network when necessary, but more
            personalised messaging can out to various departments too. This allows organizations to maximize the impact
            of their communications. Various content can easily be delivered across the whole network with a push of a
            button creating a more efficient and streamlined communication process.</p>

        <h3>Maximize high traffic areas</h3>

        <p>Today all businesses need to consider the impact of stress and anxiety on their staff. Most organizations
            have a variety of services available to their staff to help cope if they feel they are struggling. More
            often than not this information isn’t easily found and can be missed by those who may need it most.</p>

        <p>Digital signage can create an opportunity to showcase the <a
                href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/work-related-stress" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener" title="Article about work related stress">importance of health within the workplace</a>
            and the services available to those who feel they need it. Since digital signage allows for custom content
            on individual screens if necessary, it can be used in high traffic areas, such as break rooms, and hallways
            to deliver messaging that people can view when they have a moment. It can show staff they are valued and
            their wellbeing is important to the business.</p>

        <img src="images/content-delivery.png" alt="delivery of new content for digital signage">

        <h3>Convenience</h3>

        <p>Digital signage technology provides a convenient platform on which to communicate and display various
            content. This, in turn, eliminates the process of waiting for printed signage and manually placing it
            throughout the business. It can drastically reduce wastage and the time required to ensure messaging is
            correct and up to date.</p>

        <p>Workplace communication can now be done easily with the push of a button to reach all areas of the business,
            or only specific areas if needed. Communication now becomes seamless across all channels with a uniform
            message delivered in a timely and more efficient way.</p>

        <h3>More effective workplace communication</h3>

        <p>Digital signage provides a powerful, versatile and simple way to deliver key messaging and drive employee
            engagement. It can make workplace communication more relevant with efficient delivery and up to date
            content. As the world becomes more and more connected, digital signage is the logical step to bring that
            connectivity into the workplace.</p><br>
