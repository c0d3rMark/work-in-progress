        <p>Signage is a means of communicating and messaging to an audience through the use of visual graphics and
            signs. Signage is used in many different ways to deliver key information, but is most commonly used for
            marketing and promotion. It has become an integral part of everyday life and an essential tool in any
            business with a brick and mortar store.</p>

        <p>Businesses have used signage for many years to attract and inform new and existing customers. In this time
            few changes have been made to the way signs are delivered and displayed. Has the role of signage changed
            over the years? And, is it still considered important?</p>

        <p>With advancements in technology, signage is undergoing an evolution. <a
                href="https://avido.com.au/digital-displays-hardware.html" target="_blank"
                title="Browse digital signage hardware">Digital signage</a> is bringing about new and powerful ways to
            engage audiences and deliver more information than ever before. However, many businesses are still using
            static signage techniques to communicate and deliver their message.</p>

        <p>So, where is signage heading? And, can this new technology improve the way businesses communicate with their
            audience?</p>

        <h2>The role of signage within business</h2>

        <p>Commercial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signage" target="_blank"
                title="Wikipedia article about signage usage and origins">signage has a long history</a> and is believed
            to date back as far as ancient Rome, Egypt and Greece. The fact that it is still in use today and is even
            more prevalent, would suggest that it is considered effective and of high importance still to this day.
            <br><br>Signage can serve many purposes, but the key areas for businesses are:</p>

        <h3>Advertising and exposure</h3>

        <p>Signage is a powerful platform to give people in the vicinity, or already within a business a snapshot of
            what a business can offer. It allows businesses to showcase their brand, products and services. As a result,
            it still plays an important role in how businesses reach potential customers or add value to existing
            customers.</p>

        <p>It is a tried and tested medium that can reach people on ground level and increase exposure. Studies are
            showing the importance of familiarity when it comes to choosing a product or brand. Derek Thompson says
            ‘sales professionals need to understand the <a
                href="https://thesalesblog.com/2018/01/19/derek-thompson-things-go-viral-science-popularity-episode-103/"
                target="_blank" title="Derek Thompson interview about the science of popularity">Mere Exposure
                Effect’</a>. In essence, we are more inclined to like something if we are somewhat familiar with it.</p>

        <p>Signage is still a highly effective and essential part of a business’s marketing mix. Accompanied with other
            forms of advertising and exposure it can ensure a clear consistent message is being presented across all
            channels of the business.</p>

        <h3>Attract customers</h3>

        <p>Signage allows businesses to attract customers with vibrant and creative content. It can create a great first
            impression and help bring new customers through the door. Once in-store, a business can show more targeted
            content to attract customers to featured products or services. Signage often uses colour and vivid graphics
            to entice and engage people. Catching people’s eye could be the difference between them coming in, or
            passing by.</p>
        <p>As a result, well thought out and captivating signage still plays an important role in how businesses attract
            potential customers.</p>

        <h3>Inform and educate</h3>

        <p>Signage is a great way to reach people and show what a business can offer. It can be used to educate, inform
            and effectively communicate with people. Whether it’s highlighting trading hours, new products or services
            which are now available, or safety information, signs are still used extensively to get the message across.
            Signage is still one of the most efficient ways to communicate with a wider local audience. Both those
            within a business, or passing by.</p>

        <h3>What is the future of signage?</h3>

        <p>From the few examples we’ve looked at, we can see signage still plays a key role in how businesses
            communicate, attract and promote themselves to potential customers. With advancements in technology, new
            ways are emerging to improve <a href="https://avido.com.au/digital-displays-hardware-page-2.html"
                target="_blank" title="Digital signage hardware">business signage</a>. Digital Signage is changing the
            way businesses can deliver messaging and engage customers.</p>

        <p>Digital signage uses LCD and LED technology to deliver vibrant dynamic content. It allows businesses to reach
            people with a wide variety of <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/321621" target="_blank"
                title="Article about the advantages of digital content">digital content</a>, such as video, webpages,
            text-based content, and images. This creates a high impact engaging experience which is more likely to
            attract potential customers.</p>

        <p>This new technology is elevating signage into a new phase. Digital signage offers many new features which can
            improve effectiveness. It allows for content scheduling. This in itself creates new possibilities for
            businesses. For instance, content can now be delivered at certain times to speak directly to specific
            demographics, or to coincide with things such as local weather. Scheduling allows for more effective
            advertising and marketing as businesses are now able to reach key audiences and deliver more relevant
            content with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayparting" target="_blank"
                title="Wikipedia article explaining dayparting">dayparting</a> and custom playlists.</p>

        <p><a href="https://avido.com.au/digital-signage.html" target="_blank"
                title="Avido digital signage showcase page">Digital signage</a> delivers maximum impact with vivid
            colour and varied, dynamic content. The fact that it can deliver varied digital content, means it is more
            likely to captivate and engage an audience. Whether the messaging is used to attract potential customers or
            showcase products and services in-store, the message is more likely to be noticed with Digital Signage.</p>

        <p>We live in the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age" target="_blank"
                title="Wikipedia article explaining the information age">information age</a>’, and as such people expect
            to be educated and informed. Digital signage offers a platform on which businesses can communicate with
            people more than ever. As has been the case with static signage, messaging is often redundant not long after
            it’s installed. New digital technology now allows businesses to share a lot more information. The space
            which was once occupied with a static sign now becomes a platform on which messaging can be changed as much
            or as little as necessary.</p>

        <h3>A new beginning</h3>

        <p>Since signage has been in use from ancient times until today, it would be safe to say it is not going
            anywhere, anytime soon. For most of that time, it has remained static and unchanged. With the arrival of
            digital signage technology, it looks like an evolution has arrived for the industry. Digital signage
            provides new ways for businesses to reach out and communicate with their audience. It’s a versatile platform
            that can be upgraded and customized to create unique experiences and will continue to grow as the technology
            becomes more widely adopted.<br><br>Ultimately, allowing for clearer communication and understanding between
            businesses and customers.</p><br>
